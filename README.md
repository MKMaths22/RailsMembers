# README

This is my second attempt at the Odin Rails 'Members Only' project. First try I did instructions in a different order and got overwhelmed by Devise --- I stopped and left it on GitHub as 'RailsMembersOnly'

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
